-attempts to compute image object bindings without supervision
-all weights and operations utilize complex numbers 
-performs somewhat well even at small scale

SA-SN-DCGAN face generator:
attempt to replicate the results of:

Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network Integrated With Self-Attention and Spectral
Normalization", IEEE, IEEE Access Volume 12, pp 154614- 154630, 17 October 2024

-did not function well; suffers from mode collapse
