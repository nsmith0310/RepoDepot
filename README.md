\## RepoDepot



A collection of applied machine learning projects focused on model development, training, and evaluation. While these do not include production inference services, code is structured to support integration into a downstream prediction or serving pipeline.



\# Tech Stack



\- Primary Language: Python

\- ML / DL: PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-Learn,

\- Data: NumPy, Pandas

\- Visualization: Matplotlib

\- MLOps / Tools: Git, Docker
