## RepoDepot



A collection of applied machine learning projects focused on model development, training, and evaluation. While these do not include production inference services, code is structured to support integration into a downstream prediction or serving pipeline.



# Tech Stack

- Primary Language: Python
- ML / DL: PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-Learn,
- Data: NumPy, Pandas
- Visualization: Matplotlib
- MLOps / Tools: Git, Docker



# Projects

- Bidirectional GRU EEG timeseries classifier
