This folder contains a mixture of basic algorithms and completed programming challenges. 

The basic algorithms are under C++ while the programming challenges are under both C++ and Python 3.
The C++ programming challenges are either reimplementations of their Python 3 versions or improvements upon them. 
The vast majority of the challenges are under Python 3.

A note on the programming challenges:

The files included run the gamut of simple to complex, and a few have non-standard dependencies.
If you would either like an explanation of any of the challenges, or would like me to include any missing dependencies, please reach out to me.

Many of these challenges (not all) are not optimal solutions to their respective problems as they were some of my earliest programs and were my primary means of teaching myself to code.
