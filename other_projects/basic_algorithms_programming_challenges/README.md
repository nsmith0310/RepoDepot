\## Basic algorithms and programming challenges



This folder contains several basic algorithms and a lot of completed programming challenges. 



The basic algorithms are in the c++ folder while the programming challenges are in both the c++ and python3 folders.

The C++ programming challenges are either reimplementations of their Python 3 versions or improvements upon them. 

The vast majority of the challenges are in the python3 folder.



\## Notes on the programming challenges:



The scripts included run the gamut of simple to complex, and a few have non-standard dependencies.

If you would either like an explanation of any of the challenges, or would like me to include any missing dependencies, please reach out to me at nicholas.m.smith.ai@gmail.com.



Many of these challenges (not all) are not optimal solutions to their respective problems as they were some of my earliest programs and were my primary means of teaching myself to code.



Some of the programming challenges were completed using external sources and the comments in the individual files should credit those sources when

applicable.
