## Complex weighted autoencoder

Annotates and implements a minimalistic version of the model described in:

Gopalakrishnan, Anand, Aleksandar Stanić, Jürgen Schmidhuber, and Michael Curtis Mozer. 2024. “Recurrent Complex-Weighted Autoencoders for Unsupervised Object Discovery.” In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, edited by A. Globerson, L. Mackey, D. Belgrave, A. Fan, U. Paquet, J. Tomczak, and C. Zhang, 37:140787–811. Curran Associates, Inc. https://doi.org/10.52202/079017-4468

- attempts to compute image object bindings without supervision

-a ll weights and operations utilize complex numbers 

- performs somewhat well even at small scale
